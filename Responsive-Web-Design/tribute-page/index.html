            <h2>The Father of Modern African Literature</h2>
            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as the dominant figure of modern African literature. His first novel, "Things Fall Apart" (1958), is the most widely read book in modern African literature.</p>
                
                <p>Born in Ogidi, Nigeria, Achebe excelled at school and won a scholarship for undergraduate studies. He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories as a university student.</p>
                
                <p>After graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos. He gained worldwide attention for "Things Fall Apart" in the late 1950s; his later novels include "No Longer at Ease" (1960), "Arrow of God" (1964), "A Man of the People" (1966), and "Anthills of the Savannah" (1987).</p>
                
                <p>Achebe's work has been translated into more than 50 languages, and he is celebrated not only for his literary achievements but also for his eloquent advocacy of African culture and his sharp critique of European colonialism.</p>
